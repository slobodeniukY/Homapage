        <div><h1 >What you need to know about impostor syndrome?</h1></div>

        <p>In simple terms, the impostor syndrome is when even an excellent specialist unreasonably considers himself incompetent and sincerely feels discomfort in relation to the work done.
            He assures himself that he cannot cope with the task at 100% and that he will definitely be fired as soon as a suitable candidate is found.</p>
        <p>A bit of history. Psychotherapists Pauline Klens and Susan Imes were the first to describe the term "Imposter Syndrome" in 1978. According to them, it occurs in childhood if the child is not praised for achievements.
            At the same time, even modern psychologists do NOT consider it a psychological disorder, but refer to the “character traits” of a person. Modern research and surveys show:</p>

            <ul class="border">
                <li>70% of the world's population has an "impostor syndrome" - research by psychologists at Brigham Young University (Utah);</li>
                <li>86% of Twitter users have experienced "Imposter Syndrome" at least once in their lives - Dr. Jessica Barker's Twitter user survey that formed the basis of her SteelCon speech;</li>
                <li>
                    Albert Einstein (Nobel laureate), Bertrand Russell (famous philosopher), Sheryl Sandberg (COO of Facebook),
                    Jim Carrey (actor and public figure) and hundreds of other famous personalities have noted that at different stages of life they experienced “imposter syndrome”.</li>

            </ul>
            <h2>What causes impostor syndrome?</h2>
            <p>1. Belief that mistakes on the way to the goal are unacceptable.
                In school years, parents and teachers teach that “mistakes are bad” and “the ideal is achievable if you are diligent and constantly improve results.”
                Growing up, we do not always know how to realize the value of our victories and achievements. As a result, it is difficult for us to assess the level of our competence.</p>
                <p>2. Life does not stand still.
                    Every day there is new knowledge, technology is becoming more and more perfect and often even the most experienced specialists think that they do not have time to do anything.
                    Not to mention the fact that the knowledge gained in universities and specialized schools becomes obsolete even before our graduation.
                    For the IT sector, this is especially true, since trends in programming languages ​​change each other faster than developers learn them.</p>
                    <p>3. Fear of not knowing something in your professional field.
                        Communicating with more competent colleagues, many specialists, instead of accumulating their experience, are disappointed in their professionalism.
                        This is due to the “high school student syndrome”, who is convinced that he knows everything better than anyone else and painfully perceives competition.
                    </p>
                    <h2>What can we do to improve our condition?</h2>
                    <p>Caroline Castillon (founder of the Corporate Escape Artist agency), along with many well-known psychologists and business coaches, is convinced that the impostor syndrome is a signal of your “inner self”,
                        which indicates a readiness to become even better and more professional.
                        But in order to benefit from the impostor syndrome, you need to learn to control your emotions and accept yourself with your strengths and weaknesses.</p>
                        <ul class="border">

                        <li>Make it a rule to add created projects, achievements and achieved goals to your resume every 1-3 months</li>
                        <li>Allow yourself to make mistakes, but be sure to learn from them. After all, as the scientist and founder of Polaroid Edwin Land said: “A mistake is an event that has not yet been turned into an advantage by you.”</li>
                        <li>Expand your zone of influence more often, even if it means getting out of your comfort zone.</li>
                        </ul>
