        <div><h1 >What you need to know about Emotional Burnout?</h1></div>

        <p>Emotional burnout occurs as a result of the internal accumulation of negative emotions without a corresponding "discharge" or "liberation" from them.
            It leads to the depletion of the emotional-energetic and personal resources of a person.
        </p>
        <p>Burnout syndrome is characterized by emotional and mental exhaustion, decreased job satisfaction, and physical fatigue. In this case, life does not bring you joy, and work - satisfaction.
            Your nerve forces are exhausted, this problem needs to be dealt with in time. As a result, it turns out that a person becomes indifferent to everything. In place of pity for others comes a lack of understanding. The attitude is also changing not only towards patients or clients, but also towards employees, family, when a stream of aggression and contempt is poured on innocent people. And where did that friendly person everyone knew go?
        </p>
        <p>The syndrome of emotional burnout in social professions is quite common, unfortunately, not everyone takes the necessary measures to prevent or treat it.
            Even more surprising is that many do not even know what it is, and the symptoms of burnout syndrome are attributed to ordinary fatigue.
        </p>
        <h2>Prevention of emotional burnout</h2>
        <ul class="border">

            <li>Choose a time to rest, at least one day a week you will spend useless in terms of profit.</li>
            <li>Make sure that this time should be inviolable. Turn off your phone and anything else that might get you busy.</li>
            <li>Record this time and space (where and with whom you will spend time uselessly) in the calendar. Why do we write the time of important business meetings in the diary, but not the rest time?</li>
            <li>Find a way to switch to another activity. Here is a list of paradoxical activities: start cooking, walk, learn a new “useless” skill that you will never get paid for
                (learn to sing, draw, play musical instruments, play some kind of tricky game).</li>
                <li>It should be remembered that the true cause of stress is not people, not disappointments, not mistakes, but how you feel about it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Psychologists believe that in order not to become a victim of the syndrome, you must, first of all, treat yourself, other people and your work correctly.

                The main thing - remember: burnout syndrome is not a disease and not a sentence, it's just the ability of your psyche to respond to emotional overload.</p>
