        <h2 class="centered">Hi, guys! My name is Jane</h2>
        <p>I live in Ukraine, I am 27 years old and now I am changing my life.
            A few years ago I studied at the National Transport University in Kyiv, but there is nothing more boring than doing something you don't like.
            I didn't like my job, my way of life and the way I spent my free time. So I decided to do something to change that...</p>
        <p>I was born in the magnificent city of Zhytomyr, which is famous not only for cool socks, but also for famous people:
            Alexander Zinchenko (Ukrainian football player), Nina Matvienko (singer), Raisa Nedashkovskaya (actress), Valeriy Kharchishin (rock musician),
            Sergey Korolyov (famous designer and scientist), Lesya Ukrainka (poetess), Yuliya Olishevska (athlete, European champion in 2012).
            Then, like everyone else, I went to school, played music and volleyball. After graduating from school, she entered the university and moved to Kyiv.
            In parallel with my studies, I worked....worked a lot :(</p>
        <p>Three years ago, I took a short break to realize what I had achieved.
            And I realized that in fact I have nothing that I could really be proud of. I took it upon myself to change it. Of course, I wanted to start with work and profession.
            Hours of thought led me first to writing sales copy and SEO. I liked it, especially working remotely. This was very relevant when Ð¡ovid19 knocked on our doors.
            But my job didn't satisfy my ambitions and as a result, I felt burnt out too quickly. A little soul-searching and I decided to become a Software Quality Assurance engineer.</p>
        <p>I read a lot, took notes, listened to lectures on YouTube, took courses, but I was always haunted by the feeling that I was not good enough.
            Later I was told that this is called the Impostor Syndrome.
            After watching videos with revelations, reading information about the difficulties in passing interviews, I still did not have the courage to submit my resume.
        </p>
        <p>Now I decided to take a more thorough approach to my training, to really give it all my free time and, finally, overcome my fear.
            I was inspired by the stories of people who started their careers in IT after 30 years. If they succeed, why can't I? That is why I am where I am.</p>
